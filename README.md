# Azure-Sentinel-Brute-Force-Detection-Lab
Built an Azure virtual machine in a controlled lab and intentionally exposed it to the internet to collect failed login attempts. Logs were ingested into Microsoft Sentinel, where they were analyzed, enriched with GeoIP data, and visualized on a world map to identify potential brute-force activity.
